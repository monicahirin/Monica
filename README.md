<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get started with our stock prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python dependencies as specified in the README, and you're ready to begin exploring and utilizing the stock prediction model.
### Prerequisites
 Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow, are set up according to the provided instructions in the README before running the stock prediction models.
* Install the requirements.txt file 
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Installation

 Here's a self-contained installation guide for our app, eliminating the need for external dependencies or services.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   https://github.com/monicahirin/Monica.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Monica
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook File (imdbscoreprediction.ipynb).
   
4.In your web browser, navigate to the notebook file and open it.

5.Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to train the LSTM model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.

6.You can also visualize model predictions and explore usage examples within the Jupyter Notebook.
